# # # Boolean expressions are statements that can be either True or False. In Python, the boolean data type is represented by the built-in data type bool.

# # Boolean expressions are commonly used for decision-making in programming.

# # Here's a breakdown with examples:

# # 1. Comparison Operators:
# # These operators are used to compare two values:

# # == (Equal to): Checks if the two values are equal.


# # print(5 == 5)  # True
# # print(5 == 6)  # False
# # print(10 == 10)  # True
# # print(5 != 8)    # True
# # print(7 < 3)     # False
# # != (Not equal to): Checks if two values are not equal.


# # print(5 != 5)  # False
# # print(5 != 6)  # True
# # < (Less than): Checks if the left value is less than the right value.


# # print(5 < 6)  # True
# # print(6 < 5)  # False
# # > (Greater than): Checks if the left value is greater than the right value.


# # print(5 > 6)  # False
# # print(6 > 5)  # True
# # <= (Less than or equal to): Checks if the left value is less than or equal to the right value.


# # print(5 <= 6)  # True
# # print(6 <= 6)  # True
# # >= (Greater than or equal to): Checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right value.


# # print(5 >= 6)  # False
# # print(6 >= 6)  # True
# # 2. Logical Operators:
# # These operators are used to combine conditional statements:

# # and: Returns True if both statements are true.

# # x = 5
# # print(x > 3 and x < 10)  # True
# # age = 18
# # print(age >= 18 and age < 65)  # True
# # print(age < 18 or age >= 65)   # False
# # or: Returns True if at least one of the statements is true.

# # x = 5
# # print(x > 3 or x > 10)  # True
# # not: Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true.

# # x = 5
# # print(not(x > 3 and x < 10))  # False
# # 3. Membership Operators:
# # in: Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object.

# # x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# # print(3 in x)  # True
# # not in: Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object.

# # x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# # print(6 not in x)  # True
# # 4. Identity Operators:
# # is: Returns True if both variables are the same object.

# # x = [1, 2, 3]
# # y = [1, 2, 3]
# # z = x
# # print(x is z)  # True, because z is the same object as x
# # print(x is y)  # False, because x and y are not the same objects
# # # is not: Returns True if both variables are not the same object.

# # x = [1, 2, 3]
# # y = [1, 2, 3]
# # print(x is not y)  # True
# # fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
# # print('apple' in fruits)      # True
# # print('grape' not in fruits)  # True
# # a = [1, 2, 3]
# # b = [1, 2, 3]
# # c = a
# # print(a is c)       # True
# # print(a is not b)   # True
# # Remember, every boolean expression will evaluate to either True or False, and understanding this concept is fundamental for decision-making in programming.


# #######################boolean expressions challenges#####################
# # 20 points each challenge...
# # problem 1: Check if a number is both even and divisible by 5.
# # The program prompts the user for a number, checks whether it meets both conditions 
# # (even and divisible by 5), and then outputs the result to the console.

# # Prompt the user for a number

# # Check if the number is even and divisible by 5

# # Output the result to the console


# # Problem 2: Number in Range
# # Description:
# # Create a program that checks whether a given number falls within a specified range, such as 10 to 20 (inclusive).

# # Input: A number (integer)
# # Output: "The number is within the range." or "The number is outside the range."
# # Hint:
# # Use the and operator to check if the number is greater than or equal to 10 and less than or equal to 20.

# # Problem 3: Password Strength Checker
# # Description:
# # Write a program that checks if a user's password meets the following criteria:

# # At least 8 characters long

# # Contains at least one digit (0-9)

# # Input: Password (string)

# # Output: "Password is strong." or "Password is weak."

# # Hint:
# # Use the len() function to check the length and the any() function with a generator expression to check for a digit.

# # Problem 4: Odd or Even and Multiple of 3
# # Description:
# # Create a program that determines if a number is odd or even and also checks if it is a multiple of 3.

# # Input: A number (integer)
# # Output:
# # "Even and a multiple of 3."
# # "Even but not a multiple of 3."
# # "Odd and a multiple of 3."
# # "Odd but not a multiple of 3."
# # Hint:
# # Use % for both the even check and the multiple of 3 check.




# # ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
# # Problem 5: Vowel or Consonant
# # Description:
# # Write a program that takes a single character as input and checks whether it is a vowel or a consonant. Assume the input is a lowercase letter.
# # Input: A character (string of length 1)
# problem5 = "Enter a letter"
# # Output: "Vowel" or "Consonant"
# if problem5 == ['a', 'i', 'e', 'o','u']:
#     print('letter is a vowel')
# else:
#     print('Letter is a constant')
# # Hint:
# # Use the in operator to check if the character belongs to the set {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}.
